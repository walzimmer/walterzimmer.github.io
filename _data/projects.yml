- project: AUTOTech.agil
  role: Primary Developer
  duration: October, 2022 &mdash; March, 2024

  description: Electric, connected and automated. The transformation of road traffic wants to be actively shaped and contribute to increasing safety and efficiency for all road users through innovations. The AUTOtech.agil consortium project aims to create an open software and electrical/electronic architecture for the future mobility system. The special focus is on the standardization of interfaces as well as modularization with the aim of reusability, updatability, and expandability of individual functional modules. This modular principle of all necessary software and hardware elements for vehicles of all types makes it easy to implement additions and extensions in research, development, production, and, above all, in the utilization phase. The architecture for driverless vehicles researched and developed in the predecessor project UNICARagil is being extended to the entire transportation system, especially in the areas of software and tools for software development. Infrastructure-based sensor technology and cooperative concepts with control rooms and clouds are also being researched in depth. Three exemplary applications are used to demonstrate and implement the concepts with social value 1) Mobility for people with age- or illness-related performance limitations. 2) The sustainable transport of critical goods such as medicines. 3) A "guardian angel function" for greater safety of vulnerable road users, for example those on foot or by bicycle. Successful achievement of the project goal is only possible through interdisciplinary cooperation between leading partners from research with 17 chairs at nine universities and industry with three SMEs and nine companies in the field of automated and connected driving. The research project is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the "Electronics and Software Development Methods for the Digitalization of Automobility (Mannheim)" funding guideline (see project sheet DLR project management organization).

- project: Providentia++
  role: Primary Developer
  duration: March, 2020 &mdash; June, 2022
  url: https://innovation-mobility.com/en/project-providentia/
  description: The "Providentia++" project by the Technical University of Munich aims to advance autonomous driving in mixed traffic conditions. The goal is to optimize traffic flow, reduce accidents, and leverage data collected by autonomous vehicles for commercial and scientific purposes. The project focuses on addressing challenges in complex traffic scenarios, such as intersections and roundabouts, where the limited field of vision of autonomous vehicles is insufficient. The project extends the existing infrastructure from the A9 motorway to urban areas in Garching-Hochbr√ºck, aiming to test and research the interaction between autonomous vehicles and infrastructure in city traffic. To enhance system reliability, the project involves merging data streams from autonomous vehicles and infrastructure, optimizing algorithms for evaluating traffic situations, and ensuring robust operation in changing environmental conditions. "Providentia++" also emphasizes the development of a platform providing real-time traffic data, offering a uniform interface for commercial and scientific third-party software. The project is executed by a consortium of research institutes and industrial partners, spanning robotics, artificial intelligence, software technology, automotive, communication technology, and semiconductor technology.
